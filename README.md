# Rocket Elevator Information System

This week we had to include a database that the administrator can access in which 3 tables are recording data 
Quotes
Users
Employees

In order to make a quote, a customer has to first log in as a user. 

The list of administrators are the ones given in the requirements document. All passwords will be : 123456 

A user is able to see his own quotes through his profile.

Administrators have access to all the quotes entered in the database.

To access to back-office, simply click on Admin in the navbar!


This week we included a Postgresql database to act as a datawarehouse from which you can make queries and get a graph.

The purpose of a good data warehouse is to better the company data treatment and facilitate business intelligence operations.

you can acces the query section at kemverynice.com/blazer.

*****NOTE*****
the data present in the database as been randomly seeded

*****Update****
IT was noted in the video that attached files didn't work. However, after checking with a local version, 
they are indeed saved, except they do not appear in the admin section, but can be seen on DBeaver. Thank you.
