# Rocket Elevator Information System

This week we had to include a database that the administrator can access in which 3 tables are recording data 
Quotes
Users
Employees

In order to make a quote, a customer has to first log in as a user. 

The list of administrators are the ones given in the requirements document. All passwords will be : 123456 

A user is able to see his own quotes through his profile.

Administrators have access to all the quotes entered in the database.

To access to back-office, simply click on Admin in the navbar!
